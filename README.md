# Godot Action RPG Tutorial

In this project I follow the [Godot Action RPG Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAbG8Oi-SvQ&list=PL9FzW-m48fn2SlrW0KoLT4n5egNdX-W9a)
on YouTube made by [HeartBeast](https://www.youtube.com/@uheartbeast).

The Series was original made with *Godot 3.2*. My project updates the code to *Godot 4.1.2*.
Or basically I follow the project and implement the same features, but the coding part
and how things are implemented greatly differs.
